# Influencer Engagement and Sponsorship Coordination Platform

**Influencer Engagement and Sponsorship Coordination Platform** is a graded academic project developed as part of my college curriculum. The platform connects sponsors looking to advertise their products or services with influencers who earn monetary benefits through such collaborations. Built entirely with Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap, and Jinja templates, this application streamlines user engagement, campaign management, and sponsorship coordination via a responsive, user-friendly interface.

## Overview

Developed as a graded project during my college studies, this platform explores innovative approaches in influencer marketing by bridging the gap between sponsors and influencers. Sponsors can launch and monitor advertising campaigns, while influencers can manage sponsorship opportunities. The system uses a relational database for data storage, and its interface is rendered using Jinja templates styled with Bootstrap, ensuring a modern and responsive user experience.
